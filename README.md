# JAE-Intro_course

This repository contains auxiliary material for the JAE-Intro '19 mini-course "Métodos geométricos para robótica / Geometric methods for robotics" (https://www.icmat.es/events/jae-school/programme2019/).

In the folder "Group_functions" you will find a set of functions to compute some of the most common operations necessary in order to work with the Lie groups SO(3) and SE(3).

In the root, there are several programs and scripts devoted to obtaining and integrating the differential equations of a simple robotic system. The system is a planar 2-link robotic arm.
